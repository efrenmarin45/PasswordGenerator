# unit-3-passwordGenerator

This project is meant to show a randomized password generator. Giving the user the option to choose what parameters they would like in their password. This password generator is not meant to be secure but rather demonstrate working knowledge with Javascript and manipulating the DOM.

Being able to go through and try different iterations of logic was able to show me what works and what doesn't. Using the console to constantly check helped to ensure functionality.

The current build of this project is not complete and is a WIP(Work in Progress).

Only using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the page.
